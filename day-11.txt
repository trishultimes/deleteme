React
Maintence was the problem earlier just using html, css and js

some tools
jquery -> extjs -> angular -> react

why react? facebook created their own library to support millions of users

UI development challenges?
1. plan
2. design thinking need not have any technical knowledge

react
-> components
. git-bash: npm i -g create-react-app
. git-bash: create-react-app user-app ; creates a hello world program with name user-app
. git-bash: npm start -> will run our application

react applications are single page applications
it has a single div as default

data component management in react is called state. 

using "one way data binding"
one way data we cannot change the data

we need 2 way data binding to also read, editable
In react state is immutable, but are replacable?


. git-bash: npm i -g json-server
. git-bash: json-server db.json --port=4200
. git-bash: npm i axios



git (?)
. main, master
